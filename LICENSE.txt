and it's Source Code are being provided for the purposes of education and entertainment. 

Commercial use of the Source Code is also authorized, but please keep in mind the following:

   a) I have no idea what I'm doing, so you are using the code at your own risk.

   Ramifactor, nor any of their associated logos, visual identities, images or audio files.

This license does not authorize you to distribute the Game in any way, unless it does not 
include any of the Intellectual Property or Game Assets.
