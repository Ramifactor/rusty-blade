# Rusty Blade Source Code

#### This is the official home of the GameMaker Source Code for Rusty Blade, a game created by Ramifactor for AGBIC 2017.

The game source code is being released under a free license to satisfy the [Remember to FLOSS!](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2017/topic/140342/diversifiers) diversifier requirement of the game jam. 

Please read the attached LICENSE.txt if you are considering using this work for your project. 

If you have plans for a project and you want to use assets from the game or anything else not covered by the license, please contact me to discuss, or create a topic in the [Rusty Blade Community](https://ramifactor.itch.io/rusty-blade/community). 

### Disclaimer: I suck at this

As a general rule, I have no idea what I'm doing. The source code is a product of my limited GML knowledge, therefore it probably sucks. Treat it like it's someone's first game, because that's what it is.
