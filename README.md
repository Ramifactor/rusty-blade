# Rusty Blade Source Code

#### This is the official home of the GameMaker Source Code for Rusty Blade, a game created by Ramifactor for AGBIC 2017.

The game **source code** is being released under a free license to satisfy the [Remember to FLOSS!](http://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2017/topic/140342/diversifiers) diversifier requirement of the game jam. 

Please read the attached [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) if you are considering using this work for your project.

### Disclaimer: I suck at this

As a general rule, I have no idea what I'm doing. The source code is a product of my limited GML knowledge, therefore it probably sucks. Treat it like it's someone's first game, because that's what it is.
